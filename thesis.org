GNU/Linux is one of the most popular general purpose operating system used today
because of its robust performance, free availability and open nature of
development. All discussions on development and direction of the project happens
in public mailing lists and open for anyone to participate. Today, there are
well over 1 billion devices running GNU/Linux including smartphones (e.g. Android),
embedded devices, autonomous cars, robots (e.g. ROS) and most of the servers
running the Internet.

There are over 18 million lines of code in last release of Linux, licensed
under GNU General Public License, version 2 cite:GNUGener72:online. According
to Distrowatch cite:DistroWa62:online , a popular website tracking Linux
distributions, there are 275 GNU/Linux distributions including special purpose
distributions built to work on old hardware, embedded devices, desktops,
special servers etc. Henceforth, any mention of the term /Linux/ corresponds to
the Linux Kernel unless explicitly specified.

** Linux and Security

Security is an important aspect of any operating system and a large number of
critical infrastructures today runs on Linux, it is important to asses its
current state of security. There are over 1100 CVEs[fn::CVE database
cite:CVECommo56:online is a common database of all the security vulnerabilities
reported against softwares, maintained by a non-profit organization called
MITRE Foundation cite:TheMITRE0:online.] reported against Linux in past 10
years (2007-2016).


While this number is alarmingly high for a project on which a lot of critical
infrastructure depends today, by itself, it's a poor metric to measure Linux's
security. Vulnerabilities are simply bugs in a software that have security
implications. Measuring the security impact for each bug may not be trivial in
case of a system software like Linux. Vulnerabilities found via testing
techniques like fuzzing, static analysis, regression testing are often not
exploitable. 

** Problem to be addressed by this thesis

#+NAME: fig:yearly-distribution-of-vulns
#+CAPTION: Yearly distribution of CVEs for the past decade
[[./images/vulns-trends.pdf]]

Most vulnerabilities, or software bugs in general, often follow a pattern that
is repeated. Multiple variants of a vulnerability can be found in the different
parts of the code. These types of vulnerabilities have been known to us for a
long time, but, they are still show up frequently in Linux. If we look at the
frequency of these vulnerabilities over past 10 years, we see that they have
always been on rise. It can safely be assumed that unless there is a
groundbreaking change in the process of how Linux is developed, these
vulnerabilities will continue to show up.

#+NAME: fig:cvss-distribution
#+CAPTION: Relative distribution of Common Vulnerability Score (v2.0) for past 10 years of Linux kernel CVEs.
[[./images/cvss-distribution.pdf]]

So, what can be done to make Linux more secure, beyond fixing the
vulnerabilities as they are found? To answer this question, we take a step back
and notice exactly what a vulnerability is. According to RFC2828
cite:RFC2828I29:online, a vulnerability is

#+LATEX: \textit{
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A flaw or weakness in a system's design, implementation, or
operation and management that could be exploited to violate the system's
security policy.
#+END_QUOTE
#+LATEX: }

Being exploitable is what differentiates vulnerabilities from other software
bugs. /Proactive defenses/ prevent the exploitation of known kind of
vulnerabilities, thus rendering them harmless from a security standpoint.

Something important to note here that CVEs are assigned to bugs that may or may
not be exploitable. The rationale behind this is based on the fact that whether
or not a bug is exploitable (and thus has security related consequences in real
world) is dependent on environment and configuration. Given that there are huge
number of permutations in which a Linux system can be configured, it is
extremely difficult to predict if a bug can be exploited or not.

** Importance of this thesis

A large number of proactive defenses have been proposed both in research
community and industry. /The PaX project/ cite:Homepage39:online, first launched
in the year 2000, hardens Linux against majority of memory corruption bugs
discussed in Chapter [[Vulnerabilities and Defenses]]. /grsecurity/ provides
defenses against some memory corruption vulnerabilities, a Role Based Access
Control (RBAC) system and strict policies for access control in user-space. Over
the years, The PaX Team and grsecurity have teamed up to maintain patches for
stable version of Linux which includes defenses from both projects. Since April
2017, PaX/gesecurity patches are only available to paying customers of Open
Source Security, Inc.

Research community has also produced countless research papers targeted to
specific kinds of vulnerabilities and attacks with varied amount of success in
terms of industry adoption, performance and security coverage.

This thesis tries to bring together the ideas from research community and
industry to present a coherent view of the current state of the art defenses and
techniques. It tries to compare security coverage and guarantees along with
their performance to understand the practical usability of these defenses.

It also includes a quantitative survey of security vulnerabilities reported
against Linux kernel in past decade and categorizes them into various classes
and sub-classes based on identifiable patterns in them. Figure
[[fig:distribution-of-types]] shows the relative number of vulnerabilities of
different types that we identified. Each of these vulnerabilities are discussed
in detail in Chapter 3. The final goal of this thesis is to analyze which of
these classes do not have efficient and practical proactive defenses in use
today.

* Background
  
** What is a CVE?

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a central database of publicly
known cyber-security vulnerabilities cite:CVECommo56:online. Unique identifiers
for each vulnerability is assigned by a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA),
organizations authorized to identify and assign CVE IDs to vulnerabilities, and
published by the primary CNA, The MITRE Corporation. To request a CVE number,
one needs to contact one of the CNAs along with the bug report and other
relevant information related to fixes. The MITRE Corporation publishes a list of
CVEs on the CVE Website cite:CVELi79:online after it has been disclosed and
fixed. To prevent disclosing a vulnerability before it has been fixed, The MITRE
Corporations coordinates with the original projects on the release date.

For Linux kernel, security fixes are often coordinated among the major
distributions like RedHat, Debian, OpenSUSE etc. and the vulnerability is
published on the CVE Website only after the relevant security patches have been
made available.

 Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an open industry standard
cite:NVDCVSS22:online for scoring vulnerabilities based on factors like access
complexity, access vector, authentication requirements and impact on
confidentiality, availability and integrity.

** What is a Kernel?

#+NAME: fig:image
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.6\textwidth
#+CAPTION: An Operating System Kernel
[[./images/kernel.png]]

A kernel is a system software that manages hardware and facilitate its access to
application software. Linux is an operating system kernel written in C. The code
for kernel is loaded in a special memory area called /kernel-space/ and is
mediated through support of privileges from hardware. Loading the kernel in a
privileged space prevents it from being overwritten by other programs. A kernel
provides an abstraction layer over hardware functionalities through /system
calls/.

Linux is a monolithic kernel, which means everything runs in the same address
space for performance reasons.  Microkernels, run only minimally required
services in kernel space and the rest of the services run in a separate address
space for non-privileged processes. This makes Microkernels lean reducing their
startup time and the size of the computing base that needs to be trusted.

#+NAME: fig:privilege-rings
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.5\textwidth
#+CAPTION: Privilege rings in x86 architecture.
[[./images/privilege-rings.png]]

Privilege rings are heirarchial In x86 systems, there are four privilege rings from 0-3 with 0 being the most
privielged and 3 being the least privileged ring (see fig [[fig:privilege-rings]]
). Linux however uses only two of these rings, ring 0 for kernel (also called as
supervisor mode) and ring 3 for application software.

*** Virtual Memory

Virtual Memory is a technique used by modern operating systems for memory
management that presents a large contiguous range of (virtual) address space to
an application. Modern hardware include an /address translation unit/ (a.k.a
/Memory Management Unit/ (MMU)) which automatically translates virtual addresses
(corresponding to location in virtual memory area) to physical addresses
(corresponding to actual address in hardware) in the CPU. The range of Virtual
Memory Area (VMA) can exceed the capacity of the physical memory, which allows
application to address more memory than the physical capacity.

#+NAME: fig:vma
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.5\textwidth
#+CAPTION[Virtual Memory]: Virtual Memory Area. The green regions are portions of VMA that are mapped to physical memory. The red regions denote the physical memory that belong to other processes and are not-accessible to current process. The remaining grey regions in VMA denote the memory regions that are not currently in physical memory and are either present on the disk or empty.
[[./images/vma.png]]

*** Memory Management and Paging in Linux

Paging is a mechanism that translates a linear memory address to a physical
memory address.  Entire memory of an operating system is divided into small
chunks, which makes it easy to addresses them. These chunks are called
/pages/. In Linux, pages are commonly 4Kb in size, however, /huge pages/ are
bigger in size and can be either 4Mb or 1Gb in size.

Each page has an associated metadata, which includes information about the
current status of the page, if the page is currently in the memory or is it
swapped to disk, the current permission level etc.

*** Memory Allocators in Linux

Some portion of the RAM is permanently reserved for kernel to use and stores
both the kernel code and the static kernel data structures. The remaining part
is called dynamic memory and is managed and allocated by kernel to user-space
and kernel-space processes.

**** Zone Allocators

The /zone page frame allocator/ takes care of memory allocation requests for
groups of contiguous page frames. /Zones/ are specific regions of physical
memory allocated for specific purposes, for example ~ZONE_DMA~ is for direct
memory access, ~ZONE_HIGHMEM~ is used for higher range in memory, ~ZONE_NORMAL~
is used for other normal requests. Each zone also has a /per-CPU page frame
cache/ that is a cache of single pages for frequent use.

**** Buddy Allocators

Inside each zone, /buddy allocator/ manages individual pages. Buddy allocator
handles requests for contiguous page frames grouped into sizes of 1, 2, 4, 8,
16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024 contiguous pages. These pages have a
contiguous linear address but can possible be fragmented in physical
memory. Buddy allocators prevent fragmentation of linear addresses and are
efficient as they deal with only page-sized chunks of memory.

**** Slab Allocators

While buddy allocators are efficient as they deal with only large chunks of
memory, it is quite wasteful to request an entire page to store only a few
bytes. Slab allocators act as memory caches with reserved pages based on the
type of data to be stored, resulting in very fast memory allocations.

Various parts of kernel tend to request a similar sized chunk of memory very
frequently. Instead of un-allocating those memory regions, Slab allocator
re-uses the free'd memory region for next request, essentially recycling the
memory region. This results in much faster memory allocation as memory region is
never de-allocated and re-allocated. 

Linux includes three Slab allocators:

- *SLOB allocator*: This is the first type of Slab allocator, built with focus
  on compact memory storage
- *SLAB allocator*: This allocator is confusingly also named as SLAB and is
  built with cache-friendliness in mind by aligning objects to cache-boundaries
- *SLUB allocators*: This is newest type of Slab allocator and is built with
  focus on simple instruction counts, better support for debugging and
  defragmentation

#+CAPTION: Categorization of Vulnerabilities
#+NAME: fig:categorization
#+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [p]
[[./images/categorization-of-vulns.png]]

- *Un-initialized data* vulnerabilities are a result of missing initialization
  of data structures before they are exposed outside of kernel-space memory.

- *Use-after-free* vulnerabilities happen when there exists a reference to a
  freed memory region which can be exploited by placing a valid new object at
  the same memory region.

- *Bounds* vulnerabilities happen because of missing or wrong bounds checks on
  data moved between kernel-space and user-space memory. It also includes wrong
  length calculations and array index errors vulnerabilities.

- *Null derference* vulnerabilities are result of NULL pointers being
  dereferenced before null-check in kernel.

- *Format String* vulnerabilities happen when un-trusted format strings find
  their way into string formatting functions leading to information disclosure.

- *Race conditions* occur because of poor handling of locks around critical
  sections of memory when accessed by multiple threads or processes.

- *Miscellaneous* includes all the other vulnerabilities that do not fall into
  any of the categories mentioned above and while these do have some
  commonality in their types, no proactive defenses are known for these.


Following sections explore each of the above mentioned classes, their
exploitation methodology and existing defenses against them. Defenses were
collected from the last public release of PaX/grsecurity (April 2017),
proactive defenses added to Linux in past few years and research papers
published in past 6 years.

** Un-Initialized Data

#+END_LATEX

An un-initialized object can leak sensitive information from kernel memory when
it's moved across privilege boundaries like user-space memory, network,
filesystem etc. This happens when a region of memory allocated to an object
contains sensitive information and because of the missing initialization, the
sensitive data continues to persist in the object. Such object, when copied to
user-space memory for example, leaks information previously stored in kernel
memory. Missing initialization of function pointers can cause NULL
pointer dereference leading to OOPS[fn::OOPS is a Linux terminilogy for
deviation from normal behavior of the kernel. It may result in a Kernel panic
or crash but can also result in continued operation with reduced
reliability. OOPS often results in an error log which can help administrators
debug the actual cause of crash.] (CVE-2011-2184), privilege escalation
(CVE-2009-2692, CVE-2008-2812) and other potential attacks discussed in section
[[Null Dereference]].

A total 128 vulnerabilities of this kind were reported against Linux in past 10
years, which accounts for 11.54% of total vulnerabilities. Information obtained
by exploiting them is useful in building attacks that break other defenses like
Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). ASLR is a technique used to randomize
the base address of various sections in the Kernel memory in order to thwart the
attacks that re-use the code segments by indirect call transfers. They are
called code-reuse attacks or return-oriented programming attacks and are
discussed in section [[Return-Oriented Programming attacks]].

Another source of un-initialized data vulnerabilities is padding added to /word/
align [fn::A /word/ length is a specific property of CPUs and is defined by it's
architecture. Majority of the registers in a CPU can hold data of /word/ size. ]
the data structures at compile time. This padding is often[fn::This varies from
compiler-to-compiler and depends on data structure and type of

memory and is out of programmer's control since they are added at compile time.

*** Mitigation Techniques

There are several defense techniques proposed to defend against un-initialized
data related attacks. Table [[table:null-dereference]] provides a brief summary of
all the defense techniques ordered by the year they were first published in
public domain. Each of the defenses are then mentioned in detail along with
their defense strategy, performance overheads and coverage.

**** PaX

*PaX* patchsets are a collection of security enhancements to Linux that defend
against several vulnerability classes that lead to memory corruption.

***** PAX MEMORY STACKLEAK
is a GCC plugin from PaX which clears the kernel stack before a function returns
to the user-space. While this can prevent leakages from any previous system
call, data from current system call will still leak. According to the analysis
performed by Lu. et. al. cite:Lu2016, its performance overhead is high and can
rage from 2.6% to 200% depending on the workload.

***** PAX MEMORY STRUCTLEAK
 is a GCC plugin, also a part of PaX, which zero initializes local structures
that can be copied to the user-space in future as a preventive measure for
missing initializations. The performance impact of this is less as compared to
~PAX_MEMORY_STACKLEAK~ but it offers less coverage. The fields to be
zero-initialized are determined based of ~__user~ annotations of the
fields. However, ~__uesr~ doesn't cover all the structures that will be copied
to user-space and isn't explicitly used only for the structures that will be
copied to user-space in future. It also doesn't recognize all the different
types of initializers leading to some false positives.

***** PAX MEMORY SANITIZE
erases memory pages (allocated using /buddy allocator/) and slab objects
(allocated using /slab allocator/) as soon as they are freed by writing NULL
values to them. This technique is called *memory sanitization*, by erasing the
memory pages when they are /freed/, the lifetime of sensitive data can be
reduced preventing future leaks. For better performance, one can disable erasing
of Slab objects at the cost of lesser coverage.

**** Protections added to Linux

***** Memory Sanitization
Linux v4.6 gained partial support for memory sanitization, a port of
~PAX_MEMORY_SANITIZE~. Sanitization happens at both slab allocator level and
page allocator level by writing a magic value to the freed regions. It includes
an additional /sanity check/ which would verify that nothing was written to the
memory by checking for magic value during allocation time. Because of the high
performance overhead, this feature is disabled by default.

***** STRUCTLEAK
~PAX_MEMORY_STRUCTLEAK~ GCC plugin was ported over to Linux 4.11 which
zero-initializes all the local variables containing ~__user~ annotations.
~GCC_PLUGIN_STRUCTLEAK~ is the configuration option that enables this feature.

Expanding on this coverage is ~GCC_PLUGIN_STRUCTLEAK_BYREF_ALL~ in Linux 4.14,
which zero-initializes all the local variables which are passed by reference.

**** Proposed Defenses in Research

One of the oldest technique to detect un-initialized data at compile-time is
static analysis of the source code. Peiro et. al. cite:Peiro2014 use taint
analysis to track memory regions from source (i.e. allocation) to their sink
(e.g. copy to user-space, sent over network) to make sure that no un-initialized
data structures leak. Their implementation can only detect allocations on the
stack and can only track memory within a single function boundary.

Lu et. al. cite:Lu2016 proposed UniSan to detect unsafe allocations and
automatically initialize variables using binary instrumentation
techniques. UniSan is built as a tool that takes LLVM IR (intermediate
representation i.e. bitcode files) as input and returns instrumented
binary. Because initializing all variables would incur a high performance
overhead, it uses static data flow analysis to initialize only those variables
which can leak to user-space.

Milburn et. al. cite:Milburn2017 proposed SafeInit, as a plugin to LLVM compiler
toolchain, which initializes all variables unconditionally and then optimizes
their code to remove initialization for certain variables that are never used in
any context that they can be exposed. They claim to fix a wider range of
un-initialized data vulnerabilities than UniSan.

Chow et. al. cite:Chow proposed a strategy in year 2005 called /secure
de-allocation/, which involves writing /zero/ values to the memory pages after
they are freed. Kernel pages are marked /dirty/ when they are freed and can only
be used after they have been cleaned (zeroed) by a long running kernel daemon
thread. This thread periodically scans dirty pages and zeroes them if they have
been dirty for a certain fixed time. A downside to this scheme is that it
doesn't seem to cover slub allocators like SLUB, SLAB or SLOB which can re-use
the same pages for different objects without freeing them.

One thing to note here is that all the memory sanitization techniques mentioned
above, that sanitize memory region when they are freed, do not provide absolute
safety against information disclosure. Memory leaks when the memory is never
freed cannot be covered by these methods in long running daemon processes for
example.

*** Analysis

Un-initialized data vulnerabilities make up for 11.54% of all the
vulnerabilities found (see Table [[table:all-vulns]]). Defense mechanisms from
PaX/grsecurity (~PAX_STACKLEAK~, ~PAX_STRUCTLEAK~, ~PAX_MEMORY_SANITIZE~) have
very high overheads as mentioned in Table
[[table:null-dereference]]. ~PAX_STACKLEAK~ also doesn't prevent from leaks in the
current system call as it clears the stack for all previous system calls. Linux
gained support for memory sanitization, a port of ~PAX_MEMORY_SANITIZE~, but it
also suffers from same problem of high performance overhead and is thus
disabled by default.

Research papers like UniSan cite:Lu2016 and SafeInit cite:milburn2017 can
achieve acceptable performance and show promising guarantees. They
zero-initialize only the data structures that are ever exposed outside of
kernel. According to their analysis, they are able prevent all the
un-initialized data vulnerabilities reported against Linux from being
exploited. Both of them can also detect leaks caused by paddings added by
compiler to optimize the size of data structures by aligning them with processor
/word length/. These paddings can also reveal sensitive information and is
beyond the control of a programmer since they are added during compile
time.

#+END_LATEX

Use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability occurs when an object in memory is accessed
after it has been destroyed (freed). These are also termed as /temporal memory
errors/ or /dangling pointers/ [fn::A pointer pointing to a deleted object is
called /dangling pointer/.].  Most of the UAF vulnerabilities target heap
allocations as they are managed manually, but sometimes a local variable can
escape from local scope if they are assigned to a global pointer causing a
temporal memory error after the function returns and stack frame is
cleared. Stack based UAF vulnerabilities haven't been reported for Linux in past
10 years.

A total of 47 UAF vulnerabilities were reported against Linux in past 10 years
which accounts for 4.24% of total vulnerabilities reported. /Double free/
vulnerabilities are a special case of UAF when the memory region is freed twice
leading to panic (denial of service) (CVE-2012-1853, CVE-2010-3080).

Most cases of UAF vulnerabilities end up with a Kernel OOPS or panic as the
pointer being used often points to invalid memory. But, in some cases, the
pointer could be valid if a new object was allocated on the same memory region
the pointer points to. This can be used to point a legitimate pointer to an
attacker controlled object.  Exploiting a UAF vulnerability commonly involves
three steps:

1. An object is freed while a pointer to it exists,
2. Second object is allocated on the memory pointed by the pointer in (1),
3. Kernel de-references the pointer to get attacker controlled data,

**** Step 1

Executing all these three steps in correct order is important for a successful
exploitation. CVE-2016-0728 cite:CVECVE2084:online allowed local users to gain
privileges by controlling a kernel keyring object due to use-after-free
vulnerability. This particular vulnerability was a result of reference counter
overflow, which allowed the object to be freed when its reference counter
reached zero. Reference counters are implemented as integers in Linux, which
makes them vulnerable to overflows [[Integer defects]].  A total of 11 reference
counter related vulnerabilities were reported in our analysis of past 10 years.

 A mis-management of reference count causes an object to be freed, even when
there are valid references to the object(CVE-2009-3624, CVE-2014-2851). Bugs in
the memory management code which allows objects to be freed pre-maturely is the
single largest cause of UAF vulnerabilities. Often this happens due to corner
cases and un-common errors which are not handled properly.

**** Step 2

Linux uses /freelist/ [fn::Freelists are linked lists of pre-allocated memory
regions for object(s) of a particular size for faster allocation.] based memory
allocators for objects called /Slab allocators/. There are three Slab
allocators in Linux , SLAB, SLUB and SLOB. Each Slab allocator is built upon a
different philosophy and use-case, but they are often predictable when
allocating objects. By allocating multiple objects of same size, an attacker
can reliably control the allocation of one of the objects over the same memory
region as the previously freed object cite:Xu:2015:CEU:2810103.2813637. This is
*step 2* in the attack.

**** Step 3

After Step 1 and 2, the setup for UAF vulnerability is complete and the only
thing remaining is the final execution. When the kernel de-references the
pointer, which now is pointing to an attacker controlled object, it
inadvertently gets the attack controlled data. If the object consisted of
function pointers, the attacker can replace entire functions to execute
arbitrary code.

*** Mitigation Techniques

To systematize the study of mitigation techniques, they are grouped under the
step that they try to prevent in the attack scenario mentioned in previous
section. Table [[table:uaf]] provides a summary of all the defensive techniques
ordered by the year that they were first published.

|---------------------------+------+------+-----------------------+------------------------------------+-------------------------------------|


**** Prevention of Step 1

To prevent *step 1*, pointers should not be allowed to point to freed
objects. In other words, all references to a freed object should invalidated. In
Kernel, often refcount[fn::Short for /reference count/, often used verbatim in
the source code] (mis)calculations can provide an easy way to free an object
which is still in use.

~PAX_REFCOUNT~, a part of PaX, adds checks around increment of ~atomic_t~ data
type in Linux such that its value can never overflow beyond ~INT_MAX~ [fn::INT
MAX is the theoretical maximum value of an integer data type in C, it is
determined by the processor architecture]. Other uses of ~atomic\_t~, which are
not related to reference counts, are renamed to ~atomic\_unchecked\_t~
throughout the source. This feature was ported over to Linux in v4.11 to protect
against reference counters overflows, however instead of preventing overflows in
all ~atomic_t~ types, a new type ~refcount_t~ was added to Linux and all the
reference counters will eventually be ported to use this type.

**** Prevention of Step 2

To prevent *step 2*, an adversary should not be allowed to reliably predict
memory allocations. Since Linux v4.8, freelists in the Slab allocators like
SLAB, SLUB are randomized[fn::i.e. objects allocated do not follow a simple
pattern of allocated-first-free-block] making it hard to reliably predict the
memory allocations. However, by repeated memory allocations of object of one
size, it will ultimately result in the previously freed object memory being
reused, making the attack only slightly more difficult.

DieHard by Berger et. al. cite:Berger2007 emulates the semantics of a
probabilistic infinite virtual memory[fn::Having an infinite amount of memory
would mean a memory region would never have to be reused thus thwarting UAF.]
using a bitmap based fully-randomized memory manager. It uses over-sized heap
allocations and randomization to pick free memory regions for new
allocations. DieHard was motivated by the idea of preventing memory errors.
Novark et. al.  extended this idea to provide better security and performance
and proposed DieHarder cite:Novark2010, which is also a probabilistic memory
allocator designed with security in mind. DieHarder uses sparse pages layout to
randomly allocate pages in virtual memory, provides support for ASLR by
randomizing the address of small object pages and fills freed memory with random
data to prevent it's misuse.

**** Prevention of Step 3

To prevent *step 3*, code paths that lead to dangling pointers should be
 avoided. Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASAN) is GCC plugin that tracks dynamic
 memory allocations in Kernel using compiler instrumentation techniques to
 prevent pointers to invalid memory regions. KASAN uses /shadow memory/ [fn::A
 seperate managed region of memory that is protected with other mechanisms to
 prevent un-authorized write.] to track the usage of each byte and can detect
 its unsafe usage. It incurs a significant performance and memory overhead.
 However, it can be used to find use-after-free and out-of-bounds
 read[fn::Out-of-bounds bugs happen when the length of buffer being read-from
 doesn't match the length of the data being-written to.] bugs during testing,
 which can then be fixed.


***** Shadow Memory
 has also been used in previous works like TaintTrace by Cheng
et. al. cite:Cheng2006 and Compiler Enforced Temporal Safety for C (CETS) by
Nagarkatte et. al. cite:Nagarakatte2010 to track memory allocations in a tree,
hash table or trie. A downside of tracking memory regions is that they can only
detect un-safe usage of freed memory and not the memory that has been
re-allocated.

CETS by Nagarkatte et. al. cite:Nagarakatte2010 uses shadow memory to track
information about the validity of each pointer. By associating this information
with pointer instead of the memory regions, a pointer can be invalidated when
the memory is re-allocated by changing the value of a flag. This method is
called lock-and-key mechanism where the pointer is a given a key to open the
lock in the memory region. When the memory is re-allocated, the lock changes and
the pointer can no longer access it. CETS can provide complete temporal safety,
but only if complete spatial safety[fn::Spatial memory errors happen when
pointers become invalid by pointing to out-of-bounds objects due to array index
errors or are overwritten using buffer-overflow techniques] is also guaranteed
by some other mechanism.

Oscar by Dang et. al. cite:Dang2017 uses permissions on shadow virtual pages to
prevent danging pointer attacks. By using a shadow virtual page, each object is
allocated it's own virtual page which is then destroyed when the object is
freed. Oscar presents an improved model with lower performance and memory
overheads compared to the works previous to it.

*** Analysis

Use-after-free vulnerabilities constitute for 4.24% of all the vulnerabilities
along with around 1% of refcount overflow/mis-management related vulnerabilities
which enable the first step in exploitation of a use-after-free
vulnerability. By preventing reference counter overflows using ~refcount_t~ or
~PAX_REFCOUNT_~, it is possible to prevent about 11 (about 1% of all
vulnerabilities) of the use-after-free vulnerabilities. Randomized Slab
freelists do provide probabilistic defense against them by making it hard to
predict the memory allocations from allocators, theoretically, it is possible to
bypass them using heap-spraying attacks cite:Ding.

Work done by Dang et. al in Oscar cite:Dang2017 and Cheng et. al. in TaintTrace
cite:Cheng2006 shows possible methods to thwart all use-after-free
vulnerabilities by tracking each byte of memory in shadow space for un-safe
usage but their performance overheads (table [[table:uaf]]) are too high to be used
in a production environment. Formalized fuzz testing (using a tool like
syzkaller from Google cite:GitHubgo15:online) of Linux with these features
before release or during development cycles would be the most ideal use-case of
these techniques.

** Bounds Check

#+BEGIN_LATEX
\todo[inline]{- What is a bounds check related vulnerability? How do they happen? Why study each type separately? \newline
- What is the difference between buffer overread and buffer overflow? Why are they important?}
#+END_LATEX

Any input that a software takes from outside its trusted domain should be
validated. Except for data type, the simplest validation technique is length
check -- input data should not be larger than the size of memory region it
copied to. This is also true for any data that is read i.e. only the amount of
memory required should be copied to the destination, anything extra could reveal
sensitive information outside of trusted domains. The former vulnerability is
called *buffer overflow* and the latter is called *buffer over-read*. Except for
the source and sink of the data, these two vulnerabilities are similar in every
aspect and are collectively addressed here as *bounds check* vulnerabilities.

Depending on the region of memory the vulnerability corresponds to, like heap or
stack, the effects of the overflow/over-read can vary and hence the mitigation
technique. Hence, bounds check vulnerabilities are further categorized into
three sub-categories:

- Stack Overflow/Over-read
- Heap Overflow/Over-read
- Integer Defects

#+END_LATEX

Stack overflow happens when a variable on the stack is written beyond it's
bounds to neighboring memory region. Often, this is used to overwrite the return
address at the bottom of the stack frame, so when the the function returns,
control jumps to an attacker controlled location pointed by the value of the
overwritten return address. These attacks are also called as /control flow
hijacking/ attacks as it changes the usual flow of the program by re-directing
it to a different location in memory. Data or variables which can change the
control flow of a program are termed as /control data/. Apart from compromising
the control flow, a stack overflow can also be used to inject code in the Kernel
and then execute them.

Stack overflow bugs can sometime overwrite beyond the current stack region to
neighboring page. So, when an attacker is able to overflow a stack buffer, it
can potentially corrupt the entire stack or even overwrite heap memory, which is
generally allocated just below stack region.

|------------------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------+------|

There are no known ways to completely prevent a buffer overflow at hardware
level, or at programming language level.  The best that can be done is to detect
an overflow. Most widely used protection mechanism to detect buffer overflow is
adding a random value called /stack cookie/ or /stack canary/ after the buffer
that can potentially overflow and checking it's value when function
returns. Since it increases the amount of memory used and incurs some
performance overhead on every function return, it is often not added
un-conditionally for every buffer in the stack frame. Generally, a stack canary
is added only before the return address to prevent control flow hijacking
attacks by overwriting the return address.

To manage the tradeoffs between memory overheads and security, most common
compilers (GCC and LLVM ) have options to enable overflow protection. GCC
includes three options cite:Usingthe29:online :

- ~-fstack-protector-all~: This adds a stack canary to all functions and thus
  has high memory overheads
- ~-fstack-protector~: This adds a stack canary to all the functions that
  call ~alloca~ [fn::~alloca~ is used to allocate memory on stack which is
  automatically freed] and functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.
- ~-fstack-protector-strong~: This adds a stack canary to all the functions
  covered by ~-fstack-protector~, all functions that use a local variable
  or local register references, and all the functions that have local array
  definitions.

Given that enough entropy [fn::Entropy is a measure of randomness and depends on
the source and length of data.] is used for canaries that they cannot be
de-anonymized [fn::Small values can be /guessed/ using brute force techniques in
reasonable time-frames.], they can detect stack overflows. It is still possible
to overwrite the return address by exploiting a dangling array pointer. Dangling
array pointers are arrays on stack that can be made to point to any location by
controlling it's index variable.

***** Data Execution Prevention (DEP) 
or W \oplus X (write xor execute) is a policy used to prevent any memory region
from being marked writable and executable at the same time to prevent code
injection attacks. A data region which contains attacker controlled data, if
allowed to execute, could be used for code-injection attacks. Recent processors
allow marking memory pages with a No eXecute (NX) bit which is used to
implement W \oplus X policy by removing execute permissions from all data
pages. ~PAX_PAGEEXEC~ and ~PAX_SEGMEXEC~ can emulate W \oplus X and NX
respectively in older architectures that don't have native hardware support for
it. Because they are implemented in software, they have higher performance
overheads than DEP policy using NX support from hardware.
 
***** Guard Pages
are commonly used to make sure any writes that cross the page boundary are
trapped preventing overwrite of any neighboring data structure. Until recently,
the stack region in kernel used to be directly mapped, i.e., the memory was
virtually and physically contiguous. This meant that the guard pages would have
to be mapped in the physical memory too making them very expensive[fn::Memory is
scarce in kernel-space and guard page would waste one page of physical memory
per stack page if the stack is directly mapped..]. In Linux v4.9,
~CONFIG_VMAP_STACK~ option was added to allow stack to be virtually mapped
without any need for it to be physically contiguous, which allowed the use of
guard pages to prevent overflows across page boundaries. This feature has been a
part of grsecurity patches with a configuration option called
~GRSECURITY_KSTACKOVERFLOW~.

***** PaX USERCOPY
 is another feature from PaX which adds bounds checks to any data that is copied
to and from the user-space. It modifies all the functions that copy data from
user-space to verify that the data doesn't write past the stack to prevent
overflows to heap. Depending on the architecture support for stack frame
pointers, it can also prevent the writes past the current stack frame to prevent
stack corruption attacks.

***** Hardware Based Techniques 
like /Memory Protection eXtensions/ (MPX) cite:Introduc76:online , like
recently introduced by Intel, would allow software to specify pointer bounds
with each memory allocation. Each de-reference of the pointer is then verified
to be within these bounds by the hardware. An initial study by Oleksenko et. al
cite:DBLP:Oleksenko shows promising results as compared to software based
bounds checking mechanism. However, the current iteration of the implementation
has poor support and buggy implementation. Since the software needs to provide
bounds information with each pointer, it requires considerable amount of
invasive change in the source code to support MPX. The performance impact,
though better than software based solutions, is about 50% as per the studies
done by Oleksenko et. al.cite:DBLP:Oleksenko.

*** Heap Overflow

#+BEGIN_LATEX
\todo[inline]{- What is heap overflow? Why they need to be studied separately than stack? (Mostly because of manual memory management.) \newline
- What is the main cause? (Un-trusted length values from input leading to copy of extra data from userspace) \newline
- Can it be fully protected? (In objects allocated by Slab, yes, which consists of major regions of heap. For larger memory allocations, no!) \newline
}
#+END_LATEX

Heap based buffer overflows are similar to stack overflows in mechanism,
however, due to manual memory management in heap region, there exist different
strategies to prevent heap overflows. Heap overflow can overwrite important
data structures like function pointers, object metadata or other objects on the
heap.

Most objects are allocated on heap by Slab allocators like SLAB, SLUB and
SLOB. These allocators store the metadata along with the objects in the kernel
memory, placement of which can vary depending on the allocator. In most of the
slab allocators, the metadata is stored along with the objects in adjacent
memory regions for fast access and cleaner memory layout.

A common technique to exploit buffer overflows is by providing incorrect length
values to a function that copies data from user-space to kernel-space memory
(CVE-2013-6381, CVE-2012-2119, CVE-2012-2136). This can also happen if
validation code in-correctly determines the size of data due to wrong
calculations, poor assumptions or other means.

Similar to stack,  heap overflows can also be used to inject code and be
exploited by forcing the control flow to the address of injected code in the heap.

|------------------------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------------------+------|

***** PaX
Code injection attacks can be prevented by W \oplus X policy over the heap
region. Strict ~mprotect~ from PaX prevents any region of the memory which has
been written to be marked executable in future by an ~mprotect~ system call. 

~PAX_USERCOPY~ changes the behavior of functions that copy data to or from
user-space to kernel space to check for object bounds on every copy
operation. It adds checks for validity of kernel pointers to make sure that it
points with-in address range of kernel memory, that it is not NULL, and that it
doesn't point to a zero-length memory allocation. If the pointer points to a
memory region managed by one of the Slab allocators, it also checks if the size
of the data being copied is same the size of the object. If the pointer doesn't
point to a slab allocated memory region, it checks that the data doesn't cross
page or /compound page/ [fn::Compound pages are a combination of one or more
page that can be used as a single buffer.] boundaries and doesn't span across
pages that are a part of two separate allocations.

*** Integer defects

#+BEGIN_LATEX
\todo[inline]{- What is integer overflow? Why is it dangerous? (Mostly because integer overflows are not defined in standards to it is up to the compiler to implement any behavior they wish. \newline
- Can they be prevented? (In brief no, variables can be checked for overflow by calculations during testing but cannot be detected during runtime.))}
#+END_LATEX

Integer overflows happen as a result of arithmetic operations that result in
values larger than the allocated region. Often, this happens because registers
in processors are fixed-length. They often lead to undefined behaviors in
programs if not handled properly. According to Hui et. al. cite:Hui2013 there
are four types of integer overflow related bugs that can happen, as explained
in Figure [[fig:int-overflow]]:

- Integer overflow defect
- Integer underflow defect
- Integer signedness defect
- Integer truncation defect

#+NAME: fig:int-overflow
#+CAPTION: Types of Integer defects.
#+CAPTION: Source: Metamorphic Testing Integer Overflow Faults of Mission Critical Program: A Case Study \cite{Hui2013}
[[./images/integer-overflow.png]]

One common source of integer related defects is the compatibility layer for
32bit binaries to work on 64bit architectures. Integer is represented in
hardware using fixed width registers which can store maximum up to ~INT_MAX~ in
a signed integer and ~INT_UMAX~ in an unsigned integer. Integer overflows are
undefined behavior according to C11 standard [Section 3.4.3, C11 Standard],
because of which compilers are free to handle it in any way they seem fit.

There are 68 integer overflow vulnerabilities (including 11 reference counter
overflows, which can lead to Use-After-Free bugs [[Use-After-Free]]), 10 integer
underflow vulnerabilities and 14 integer signedness vulnerabilities that were
reported against Linux in past 10 years. Integer defects can lead to various
different types of vulnerabilities like privilege escalation due to logic error
(CVE-2011-2022). Overflow of size variables can lead to small buffers being
allocated, causing an overflow later when the data is copied to the buffer
(CVE-2014-9904, CVE-2012-6703). Overflow of variables during size calculation of
data can lead to information disclosure (CVE-2011-2209, CVE-2011-2208).

**** Mitigation Techniques


#+CAPTION: Mitigation Techniques for Integer defects
#+ATTR_LATEX: :align |p{5cm}|p{3cm}|p{4cm}|p{1cm}| 
|---------------------+----------------------------+------------+------|
| Name                | Coverage                   | Bypassable | Cost |
|---------------------+----------------------------+------------+------|

|---------------------+----------------------------+------------+------|


Because these vulnerabilities result due to the behavior of the hardware, it is
hard to prevent all occurrences of these vulnerabilities. However, if it is
known beforehand that a variable can overflow, GCC includes primitives
cite:gccdocs:online to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication operations
with overflow checks.

***** PaX

~PAX_SIZE_OVERFLOW~ from the PaX patches is a GCC plugin which can detect
overflows. It does so by using a double sized data structure to compute the
output of expressions and compares that to the actual output to detect an
overflow. However, it is not possible to put this check /everywhere/ in the
source, so, it detects /interesting/ size variables in functions which can have
security implications like buffer overflow due to wrong sized memory
allocations. Variables that are intentionally allowed to overflow can be marked
so that they are not checked for overflow.

***** Testing Oracles
Integer defects and their effects on missions critical programs in C
programming language was studied by Hui et. al cite:Hui2013. The lack of
/testing oracles/ [fn::Testing oracle is a theoretical machine that can predict
the /correct/ output of a program or expression for testing.]  makes the
testing of integer defects hard. They use a technique called /mutation testing/
[fn:: Testing of programs which do not have any test oracle by mutating data
types in pre-defined fashion to detect anomalous behavior and thus determine
the presence of an integer defect.] to replace (1) /int/ with /char/, (2) /int/
to /short int/ and (3) /int/ to /long int/ along with replacing /signed/ with
/unsigned/ data types to introduce mutation.

People have proposed solutions to detect integer defects in softwares also by
training on signatures of previously known vulnerabilities. These solutions
inference type information of the variables in binaries to pre-calculate the
values that can be then compared against actual output, use the /status
register/ to check for overflows and /carry flag/ or use some other test oracle
to compare the results against.  Wang et. al. cite:Wang2014 proposed /SoupInt/,
which uses this information to check for memory allocations that are smaller
than they should be and would probably result in a buffer overflow. They use
static analysis techniques to track the variables that can potentially overflow
to functions that perform memory allocations. They also go one step ahead of
detection and generate patch by binary instrumentation to fix these flaws using
existing error handlers.

*** Analysis

*Bounds Check* related vulnerabilities account for a total of 20% of all the
vulnerabilities that are reported. Because C doesn't have any built-in support
for bounds checking, it is hard to prevent these from happening
altogether. Integer overflows can be detected (using options in GCC) but it
would cost a lot of performance to enable it un-conditionally for all integer
types.

***** Stack Overflow
Detecting stack based overflows is possible using stack canaries but only after
they have already happened and, in the best case, would result in a Denial of
Service or OOPS. ~PAX_USERCOPY~ prevents overflows past the current stack frame
preventing compromise of control flow but would still result in loosing return
address at the bottom of the stack frame causing a crash. By virtually mapping
stack (~CONFIG_VMAP_STACK~) without any need for it to be physically contiguous,
it is now possible to detect cross-page overflows in Linux by adding guard
pages. This feature was a part of grsecurity/PaX as ~PAX_KSTACKOVERFLOW~ before
it was implemented in Linux. By exploiting an array indexing bug (19 of which
were reported in past 10 years), it is possible to overwrite the return address
bypassing canaries and all other protections surveyed.

***** Heap Overflow
Heap based overflows are harder to protect because of the manual memory
management. Often un-trusted length values result in more amount data to be
copied from user-space resulting in corruption or overwrite of neighboring data
structures or metadata. ~PAX_USERCOPY~ validates the length of all objects
managed by Slab allocators preventing overflows of these objects. Features from
~PAX_USERCOPY~ are being ported to Linux to prevent these attacks and can be
assumed to be a solved problem. Buffers not allocated through Slab allocators
are still susceptible to overflows.

***** Integer Defects
Integer defects occur due to fixed width of integers in hardware registers which
allows values past a certain maximum (~INT_MAX~ or ~INT_UMAX~) to overflow and
wrap around. ~PAX_SIZE_OVERFLOW~ can detect security sensitive integers, which
define the length of memory allocations. Static analysis tools like SoupInt can
detect integer overflow bugs by comparing output from computation in hardware
with emulated calculation with double length data types in software.

** Null Dereference

#+BEGIN_LATEX
\todo[inline]{- What is a NULL dereference vulnerability? (de-reference NULL pointers to acccess page zero) \newline
- Why are they dangerous? (because userspace can map contents to page zero with relevant permissions) \newline
- How can it be prevented? (runtime options to prevent mapping, SMAP, SMEP, PXN to prevent de-reference.) \newline
- Is it a solved problem?( Kind-of, ROP can be used to disable SMAP. SMEP can prevent all code injection but SMAP will enable data attacks.)
}
#+END_LATEX

Pointers are variables that store the address of another variable or memory
region. According to C11 standard, de-referencing a NULL pointer is undefined
behavior. This means, there is no standard for what happens when a NULL pointer
is dereferenced, which leaves this decision to compilers. Often compilers use
this undefined behaviors to optimize the code and sometimes even remove checks
for NULL pointers after they have been de-referenced (since they can't be NULL
after being de-referenced.). Wang et. al. cite:Wang2012a studied the effect of
undefined behavior in C and argue that they lead to tricky real world issues
which can lead to problems in real world.

Usually, NULL (zero) pointers are considered invalid, in which case any code
that de-references a NULL pointer in user-space causes a memory error, and the
kernel will kill the process. But in kernel-space, zero is a technically valid
pointer and it would point to the /zero page/ in virtual memory. This page is
mapped with no permission bits set, so any access to it will trap into kernel
which will decide if the process should be allowed the access or not. Only
processes with ~CAP_SYS_RAWIO~ are allowed to map to page zero.


~vm.mmap_min_addr_~ is a ~sysctl~ [fn::~sysctl~ is tool used to examine and
configure parameters for Kernel. Configuration parameters are usually exposed
through ~procfs~ or ~configfs~ in the virtual file system.] knob to set the
minimum address that any process can ~mmap~ to, which is set to a non-zero value
by default in most GNU/Linux distributions. To be able to exploit a NULL pointer
de-reference, the first step would involve bypassing this protection to map
adversary controlled code or data in the zero page.

Once, an adversary can add code or data to zero page, they can use a NULL
pointer de-reference bug to use that. There were a total of 149 NULL pointer
de-reference vulnerabilities that were found, which account for 13.4% of
total. Without enough permissions, a NULL pointer de-reference results in an
OOPS and hence denial of service.

To prevent a NULL pointer de-reference vulnerability from being exploited, one
can go about two different ways:

1. Prevent any user-space application to map anything to page zero
2. Prevent any NULL pointer from being de-referenced in kernel

**** Page zero mapping

While ~vm.mmap_min_addr~ prevents any process from mapping to zero page by
default unless the process has ~CAP_SYS_RAWIO~, in past it could be bypassed by
compromising a /setuid/ [fn::setuid is a mechanism in Linux where any user
executing a binary with setuid bit set will execute the process with
permissions of the owner.] binary with required capability. Since it is allowed
to map to page zero with certain capabilities, a bug in user-space program can
be exploited to map contents in page zero. ~PER_CLEAR_ON_SETID~ is a list of
security critical flags that are cleared when a setuid binary is
executed. Since Linux v2.6.31, this list of flags includes ~MMAP_PAGE_ZERO~,
which would make it impossible to use this specific technique to map attacker
controlled code to page zero by exploiting a setuid process.

**** Page zero access

It is hard to prevent Kernel from de-referencing a NULL pointer as they are
valid pointers, but it is possible to prevent Kernel from de-referencing a
user-space pointer[fn::NULL pointer would point to user-space when Kernel is
executing in the context of a user-space process like in system calls.] when it
is expecting a Kernel space pointer. Supervisor Mode Exec Prevention (SMEP),
added to /Ivy Bridge/ [fn::Introduced with 3rd generation of Intel Core i CPUs]
microarchitecture by Intel, prevents Kernel from fetching instructions to
execute from user-space (Privilege Level 0 in Linux). In recent ARM
architectures, a similar feature called Privileged eXecute Never (PXN) was
added to prevent kernel mode access of user-space memory.. PaX's ~KERNEXEC~
uses memory segmentation in older architectures which do not support SMEP or
PXN to implement similar semantics. This can prevent de-referencing dangling
pointers controlled by attackers.

Supervisor Mode Access Prevention (SMAP), added to /Broadwell/ [fn::Introduced
with 5th generation of Intel Core i CPUs] microarchitecture by Intel, prevents
Kernel from any access to user-space memory. However, unlike SMEP, SMAP cannot
be enabled un-conditionally since there are legitimate use cases when kernel
needs access to user-space memory. For this reason, SMAP can be enabled and
disabled by writing to ~CR4~ register. PaX's ~UDEREF~ , similar to ~KERNEXEC~,
uses memory segmentation in older architectures to prevent Kernel from accessing
user-space memory. It patches all user-space accessing functions to change
segmentation related registers to temporarily allow the access.

**** Static Analysis

Static analysis tools like Smatch cite:Smatchth54:online and Coccinelle
cite:Coccinel90:online can be used to find potential NULL pointer
vulnerabilities in the source code by testing at development time.

*** Analysis
NULL Dereference vulnerabilities account for 13.44% of the total vulnerabilities
reported, highest of all other types. As discussed before, NULL dereference
vulnerabilities can be exploited if an attacker can map to page
zero. ~PAX_KERNEXEC~ and ~PAX_UDEREF~ can potentially prevent these attacks by
emulating ~SMAP~, ~SMEP~ / ~PXN~ in software, but their reliance on memory
segmentation and availability to only paying customers makes them less-likely
to be adopted in future. Static analysis tools like Smatch and Coccinelle
however can be used to find NULL dereference bugs by testing at development
time. Since ~SMAP~ can still be disabled by writing to ~CR4~ register (possibly
using a ROP attack), NULL pointer de-references can still be a security threat,
even with modern hardware support.

** Format String Vulnerability

#+BEGIN_LATEX
\todo[inline]{- What is a format string vuln? \newline
- How can it be exploited? \newline
- How many of them exist? \newline
- What are the defenses against them, if any?}
#+END_LATEX

String formatting is a common technique in programming languages to use template
strings with placeholders, which are later replaced by values to generate
desired strings. In C, functions ~printf~ and ~fprint~ are common examples which
accept these template strings and variables that represent the value to
placeholders and return a /formatted string/.

#+NAME: printf-example
#+BEGIN_SRC
char *screen = "screen";
int number = 10;
printf("Print the number %d to the %s.", number, screen);
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: Stack frame for a format string function.
#+NAME: fig:format-string
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.5\textwidth
[[./images/format-string.png]]


In the above example , ~printf~ is a /format function/, ~%d~ is /format string
parameter/ which defines the /type/ that the variable ~number~ is, and string
"~Print the number %d to the %s.~" is /format string/. Fig [[fig:format-string]]
shows their arrangement in the stack. ~printf~ pops the values from the stack
depending on the number of format string parameters in the format string. A
malicious input for the value of variable ~screen~ in the above example like
"~screen %x~" will make ~printf~ pop the next value from the stack which could
potentially be some sensitive information.

Format string parameter defines the type of input variable, like ~%d~ expects
and ~int~ or integer type. Format string parameters can be used to read from or
write to data in the stack, for example:

- ~%x~: To read bytes from memory
- ~%s~: To read character strings from memory
- ~%n~: To write an integer in the memory
- ~%p~: To print the address a pointer points to

A bug where an adversary can control the format string parameter in a format
string, can leak arbitrary memory regions (using ~%x~) or write arbitrary
memory regions (using ~%n~). In CVE-2013-2852 cite:CVECVE2033:online an input
parameter to the Broadcom driver module (b43), which is controlled by
user-space, is used in a error message without proper validations. When the
error message is printed or logged, the format string vulnerability in the
error message can cause arbitrary memory read/write. A total of only 3
format-string vulnerabilities were found in our analysis.

*** Mitigation Techniques

**** Compiler Instrumentation
GNU Compiler Collection or GCC can detect calls to ~printf~ which can
potentially lead to a format string vulnerability. When option
~-Wformat-security~ is enabled, GCC warns about calls to ~printf~ without a
literal string (i.e. input is a variable pointing to format string) and there
are no arguments to format string. If an adversary can control this variable,
they can read data from memory. Due to it's security implications, all uses of
~%n~ were removed from Linux source in the year 2014 cite:kernelgit82:online
and any future use will be ignored during compile time.

**** Strict use of format strings
Information leak from the format string parameters like ~%p~, which can reveal
kernel pointers, can only be prevented with careful use of these parameters. A
new format string specifier ~%pK~ was introduced in 2011 cite:kernelgi23:online
to hide the kernel pointers from being leaked in the logs or ~/proc~
filesystem. Depending on the value of ~/proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict~ sysctl's
value, ~%pK~ will have the following behavior:

- ~kptr_restrict = 0~ : No deviation from the standard ~%p~ behavior
- ~kptr_restrict = 1~ : If the current user doesn't have ~CAP_SYSLOG~
  capability, all kernel pointers will be printed as all 0's.
- ~kptr_restrict = 2~: All the kernel pointers are printed as 0's, regarless of
  the privileges.

*** Analysis

While format string vulnerabilities are not very common, there is no defense
mechanism that can prevent their exploitation if they somehow find their way
into the kernel. Removal of ~%n~ would make sure that format strings can't be
used to write to memory. While ~kptr_restrict~ can prevent information leaks, it
is an opt-in method, which means that it works only if all uses of ~%p~ are
carefully removed from Linux. For now, it is a matter of convention to not use
potentially dangerous format string parameters, which can lead to information
disclosure. There is nothing preventing the use of ~%x~, which bypasses any
protection provided by ~kptr_restrict~.

** Missing permission check
#+BEGIN_LATEX
\todo[inline]{- These vulnerabilities are mostly due to improper or entirely missing permission checks which allow privilege escalation, in most cases with little work. \newline
- Can these be prevented against? No, these are programming errors and it is near to impossible to check which of the data access should be mediated by a permission check}
#+END_LATEX

Missing or wrong permission check are another class of programming errors which
is very commonly seen in Linux. There are over 133 vulnerabilities reported in
Linux which were caused due to missing or wrong permission checks. Depending on
operation and context, a missing or wrong permission check can lead to variety
of attacks.

Poor handling or namespaces can lead to privilege escalations in containers
which are often isolated using namespaces in Linux (CVE-2016-1576). Bugs in
network stack can allow remote attackers to bypass firewall or other network
restrictions (CVE-2012-4444). Not clearing permissions when spawning off a low
privilege process can lead to it having un-intended permissions which it may not
be prepared to handle (CVE-2009-1895). Missing checks for file permissions can
allow arbitrary changes to append-only files (CVE-2010-2066).

*** Mitigation Techniques

Missing authorization step in the workflow makes it nearly impossible to
control the access of resource from users that aren't authorized to access it
/by design/. This makes missing permission checks vulnerability impossible to
mitigate.

** Race conditions
#+BEGIN_LATEX
\todo[inline]{- These involve poor locking around ciritical memory sections. \newline
- Can they be prevented? It is hard to check race conditions by simple testing. However, static analysis of code can detect some of these vulnerabilities. \newline
- What are the effects of it? It can lead to privilege escalation, read/write arbitrary memory.}
#+END_LATEX

Race conditions are vulnerabilities related to poor handling of critical
sections in multi-threaded or multi-process software. Usually, this occurs when
two processes running in parallel change a shared data structure without proper
co-ordination among themselves. Consider the example below:

#+NAME: race-condition-ex
#+BEGIN_SRC
if (x==10) {  // Time of check
    y = x*x;  // Time of use
}
#+END_SRC

Here, if ~x~ is a shared variable among more than one process, it is possible
that the value of x could be different when its value is checked and when it is
used in next line. This is commonly called TOCTTOU (Time Of Check To Time of
Use) vulnerabilities, and this is a simple example of a possible race
condition. The part of code operating on a shared variable is termed as
/critical section/ and it's use is often coordinated using locks to prevent a
race condition.

There are 56 race condition vulnerabilities that were reported against Linux in
past 10 years. Linux gained support for Simultaneous Multi-Processing (SMP) in
v2.0, which was released in May, 1996 cite:LinuxKer21:online . However, a
preemptive system [fn::In a preemptive system, operating system can take control
back from processes without their will. This is done to make sure a single
process doesn't starve other processes.] can suspend a thread when it is
executing in a critical section and can cause race conditions even on systems
with no support for SMP. In Linux v.2.6, support for preemption for processes
running kernel code was added.

Race conditions can result in various types of attacks depending on the shared
state that was left un-checked. In CVE-2009-1527, a wrong type of lock was used
in a ~ptrace~ system call when accessing the state of a process, which could
lead to local privilege escalation when tracing a /setuid/
application. CVE-2014-9710 allowed users to gain privileges because of a race
condition which left access control fields empty for some time which could be
leveraged to bypass intended privilege checks in Btrfs filesystem.

*** Mitigation Techniques

Race conditions are hard to detect and mitigate. Because of their nature, it is
impossible to detect them using usual testing methods. No known mitigations
exist today that can prevent exploitation of an existing race condition in
Linux.

- Can DoS be detected? Yes, common patterns of DoS can be detected by static analysis tools which can look for signatures of previous vulns. They cannot be prevented at runtime though.}
#+END_LATEX

The three basic pillars on which security of any system is defined are
/confidentiality/, /integrity/ and /availability/. There are several reasons as
to why perfect availability is impossible to achieve. We focus only on factors
that are controlled by software and ignore the failures caused by external
factors like hardware or external infrastructure. Availability is a property of
a software system, that depending on the system being observed, could mean
different things. For example, in a web service, availability implies that the
endpoint always accepts requests and returns a valid response. This
availability is representation of the service as a whole, there could be
multiple failures of individual services that comprise the web service, but due
to smart replication and request routing, the web service endpoint is always
functional.

In the context of Linux kernel, availability is defined with the responsiveness
of processes. Software bugs and crashes affect the availability of the
system. These crashes are often due to internal bugs, that can be triggered
from an un-trusted outside input. Different inputs invoke different code paths
inside kernel and a bug in any of those code paths could lead to a software
crash.

*** Mitigation Techniqes

Most denial of system vulnerabilities are simple software bugs that are fixed
quite easily when found, however, the process of finding these bugs might be
more challenging. It is hard to find a pattern in denial of service
vulnerabilities, simply due to the large number and types. /Fuzzing/ is a
software testing methodology where instead of manually curating testing data,
which could potentially be a large amount given the combinations of
environments, configuration and inputs, a tool is made to generate testing
data. These tools are generally called as /fuzzers/.

**** Fuzzers

Fuzzers are provided with basic templates of the API to be tested and are
allowed to run against a given system. The response for each request is recorded
and validated and any inconsistencies in the expected output are reported as
bugs. Linux expose a vast variety of system calls, it's API, which can be tested
using these fuzzers.

*Trinity* cite:GitHubke85:online and *Syzkaller* cite:GitHubgo91:online are
Linux system call fuzzers.  Both of them use system call templates for argument
domain specification. Syzkaller also uses code coverage information for guiding
the fuzzing.

While fuzzers can be helpful to find out some of the bugs, their coverage is
very limited. They do not provide any guarantee to find all bugs and can often
miss complicated bugs.

** Miscellaneous

While the majority of vulnerabilities are based on repeating patterns, some
aren't. These vulnerabilities are often simple programming errors that cause
un-expected side effects sometimes. Some common types include faulty
cryptographic implementations (CVE-2009-3238, CVE-2007-2451, CVE-2014-7284),
Information leaks due to various reasons that aren't a part of any of the
previously mentioned classes (CVE-2011-0710, CVE-2010-4565).

A large part of these vulnerabilities result in denial of service i.e. affect
the availability of the system. Linux has several essential processes running
in kernel mode, which when fail, push the kernel in an un-reliable
state. Several of the bugs that can generally be classified into more specific
classes of bugs, like NULL Dereference [[Null Dereference]], Buffer Overflow [[Bounds
Check]] etc, can also cause services to crash. Even simple bugs like a missing
error handler can cause kernel crashes. Compute intensive code paths, which can
be invoked from an un-trusted input, can make the system un-available to other
requests, even without a failure.

CVE-2011-1768 allowed remote attackers to cause an OOPS by sending a packet
while the ~ip_gre~ module is being loaded. CVE-2009-0747 allowed local users to
cause CPU consumption and error-message flood by trying to mount a crafted EXT4
filesystem. CVE-2015-5307 allowed guest OS users to hang host OS by raising
many Alignment Check exceptions.

CVE-2016-4440 allowed guest OS users to access APIC MSR on host OS due to poor
handling of the APICv on/off state. CVE-2013-0311, caused by a bug in
translation of cross-region descriptor, can cause guest OS to attain host OS
privileges by leveraging KVM guest OS privileges. CVE-2015-0274, caused by a
bug in XFS filesystem implementation, uses a wrong size value during attribute
replacement allowing local users to cause a denial of service or gain
privileges.


Some of these vulnerabilities can be sorted into logical groups, though, these
groups don't particularly have any good proactive defenses known yet. These
groups include:

- *Infinite Loop*: These vulnerabilities can cause loops to run indefinitely
  making a system un-responsive and un-available to perform actual work.
- *Memory Leaks*: Memory leaks can often result in huge memory consumption and
  un-availability of memory, thus starving them out.
- *Divide-by-zero*: Dividing any number by zero is an undefined operation and
  depending on the situation, it can result in a system crash. These
  vulnerabilities often happen when the variable in the denominator becomes
  zero unexpectedly.
- *Cryptography*: Several bugs in cryptographic protocol implementations can
  result in exploits as cryptography is often the basis of security in a lot of
  protocols.
- *Length Calculation Bugs*: These bugs are often caused by mis-calculating the
  size or length of a data or wrong arithmetic. It can often result in either
  too big or too small memory region being allocated and sometimes may or
  may-not result in buffer-overflow or buffer-overread.


*** Mitigation Techniques

Since these vulnerabilities don't show any common pattern in their type, it is
hard to actually prevent them from being exploited. Proactive defenses are
based on the idea of predictable behavior of vulnerabilities, which can't be
found in these vulnerabilities.

Most vulnerabilities that result in denial of service are simple software bugs
that are fixed quite easily when found, however, the process of finding these
bugs is more challenging. /Fuzzing/ is a software testing methodology where
instead of manually curating testing data, which could potentially be a large
amount given the combinations of environments, configuration and inputs, a tool
is made to generate testing data. These tools are generally called as
/fuzzers/.

**** Fuzzers

Fuzzers are provided with basic templates of the API to be tested and are
allowed to run against a given system. The response for each request is recorded
and validated and any inconsistencies in the expected output are reported as
bugs. Linux expose a vast variety of system calls, it's API, which can be tested
using these fuzzers.

*Trinity* cite:GitHubke85:online and *Syzkaller* cite:GitHubgo91:online are
Linux system call fuzzers.  Both of them use system call templates for argument
domain specification. Syzkaller also uses code coverage information for guiding
the fuzzing.

While fuzzers can be helpful to find out some of the bugs, their coverage is
very limited. They do not provide any guarantee to find all bugs and can often
miss complicated bugs.

* ROP Attacks and Protections

** Return-Oriented Programming attacks

\todo[inline]{- What are code-reuse attacks? Why are they still dangerous? (mostly because all protection mechanisms assume a perfect kernel with no other vulns.) \newline
- Are existing solutions enough to prevent all ROP? (No, most solutions both in research and industry can be broken by information leakages.) \newline
- What else can be done? CFI enforced by a higher privielged hypervisor can enforce complete safety but this study only includes protection mechanisms within Kernel.}
#+END_LATEX

Return-oriented-programming (ROP) or code-reuse attacks are based on a
combination of vulnerabilities and have been shown to bypass modern defenses
for various types of vulnerabilities discussed in Chapter [[Vulnerabilities and
Defenses]].  Given that these are attacks and not vulnerabilities, they aren't
assigned CVE numbers to quantify their frequency. Hence, they are studied
separately from other types of vulnerabilities.

ROP attacks hijack the control flow of a program by exploiting a memory
corruption vulnerability and then using existing code in memory to perform
un-intended operations cite:Skowyra2013,Li2010,Checkoway2010 . Previously
called return-to-libc cite:Shacham:2007:GIF:1315245.1315313, these attacks use
the existing code fragments in shared libraries or program binary to implement
arbitrary program logic. As these attacks got more sophisticated, their
dependence on shared libraries reduced and code fragments could be generated
using JIT compiler and within the program binary.  Code fragments, also called
/gadgets/, which end in a ~ret~ statement can be chained together to perform
turing-commplete [fn:: Turing-completeness implies that any arbitrary operation
can be performed using any random combination of system calls.]
cite:Checkoway2010 set of operations. There are typically three steps in a
successful ROP attack:

1. Exploit a memory corruption vulnerability to change a return address or
   function pointer
2. Jump to the user-controlled code using the above vulnerability and to the
   next gadget from their in a chain
3. Return to the correct location that was supposed to run in step 1

The first and most important requirement to launch a ROP attack is a memory
corruption vulnerability. If there is one thing that analysis of past 10 years
of vulnerabilities has revealed, it is that they are available in plenty.  By
exploiting a spatial memory vulnerability, as discussed in Bounds Check
vulnerabilities, section [[Bounds Check]], it is possible to overwrite the return
address of a function to jump to an arbitrary location. A NULL pointer
deference, discussed in section [[Null Dereference]], can be used to redirect
program flow to page zero. Use-after-free vulnerabilities, discussed in section
[[Use-After-Free]], allow hijacking control flow by compromising function pointer
tables. To redirect the control flow, it is also important to know the correct
address of gadgets in memory which may not always be trivial as Linux
randomizes the base address of various memory segments (ASLR).

In second step, the control jumps from the location of memory corruption bug to
a user controlled location. It is important that this location be mapped in
virtual memory area and be accessible at the call site. If this condition is not
met, any access to un-mapped region would crash the kernel or cause an OOPS
leading to an un-successful attack.

Finally, to successfully evade detection, the attack should be able to return
the control back to the program for it proceed under compromised
conditions.

***** Information Leakage
Research community has also shown that some defenses like ASLR [[Address Space
Layout Randomization]], mentioned later in defenses, can be broken using
information obtained from hardware side-channel attacks which are based on
micro-architectural features. Gruss et. al. cite:Gruss2016 use software
pre-fetching instructions to obtain sensitive information from various caches
in x86 system, Hund et. al. cite:Hund used timing channel attacks against
double page faults to discover valid memory locations, Jang et. al. cite:Jang
use Intel Transactional Synchronization Extension (TSX) from recent Intel
processors to perform timing channel using similar methods. Information
revealed from vulnerabilities in Linux can also be used to weaken the
guarantees offered by ASLR (CVE-2013-0914, CVE-2016-3672, 2015-8575, 2015-8569,
2014-9585, 2014-9419). Oikonomopoulos et. al. cite:Oikonomopoulos2016 later
showed that it is possible to determine the location of code fragments without
complicated side-channel attacks and instead relying on allocation oracles,
which repeatedly allocated chunks of memory to determine the holes in
address-space where the possible code-targets could be.

*** Mitigation Techniques

To systematize the study of all the mitigation techniques, they are grouped
based on the step that they prevent in above mentioned ROP attack. We skip over
mitigation techniques for memory corruption vulnerabilities as they have been
discussed in detail in sections [[Use-After-Free]], [[Bounds Check]], and [[Null
Dereference]].

**** Prevention of Step 1

In order to execute *step 1*, an attacker requires the address of gadgets in
memory to jump to. Memory address for a particular instruction in memory can be
calculated by adding it's offset from the start of the program to the base
address of the memory segment where the program is mapped. Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) is a technique to randomize the base address of different
section in virtual memory area. Depending on the implementation, each chosen
section could have some entropy in it's base address making it hard to guess its
value reliably. There are 256 and 512 random positions possible for 32bit and
64bit x86 Linux in current implementation of ASLR. 

***** grsecurity
~GRKERNSEC_RANDSTRUCT~ is a GCC plugin from grsecurity which randomizes the
layout of all the structures comprised of function pointers (a.k.a /ops/
structures) to make it harder to overwrite them using spatial memory
errors. Because it has a high performance overhead, another option
~GRKERNSEC_RANDSTRUCT_PERFORMANCE~ is provided which takes into account the size
of cache-line to randomize structures with reduced security guarantees. This
plugin was ported over to Linux in v4.13 but only randomizes structures that are
explicitly marked with ~__randomize_layout~ cite:kernelgi67:online.


***** Address Space Layout Randomization
32bit implementations of ASLR are vulnerable to de-anonymization attacks by
means of brute force (cite:Shacham, cite:RouterEx31:online). Randomizing ~mmap~
, each shared library, code and data segments separately can increase the
difficulty of such attacks. Kil et. al. cite:Kil proposed Address Space Layout
Permutation (/ASLP/) to randomize base address of stack, heap, shared libraries
and executable to make it harder to guess the address of code in memory, such
techniques are called fine grained ASLR. Bigelow et. al. cite:Bigelow2015
proposed re-randomization of memory space as soon as the program gives an
output to render the data revealed from information leaks useless. Lu
et. al. cite:Lu encode the code-pointers when they are treated as data so that
they are of no use when leaked to determine the address of code region.


***** Isolation
 A recent work by Gruss et. al. cite:Gruss, /KAISER/, makes Kernel Address
Space Layout Randomization (/KASLR/) more promising by proposing stronger
isolation between kernel-space and user-space memory in order to defend against
side-channel attacks. They propose removing mapping of kernel in userspace,
with exception of some portions which would allow context switch to
kernel-space memory. ARM processors have two separate page tables for mapping
user-space and kernel-space which allows stronger isolation of user-space and
kernel-space.

***** Return-less kernel
 Li et. al. cite:Li2010 proposed removing all the ~ret~ instructions using
binary instrumentation techniques as an effort to remove all the gadgets that
can be used in a ROP attack, but Checkoway et. al. cite:Checkoway2010 and
Bletsch et. al. cite:Bletsch showed that it is possible to perform ROP attacks
even without ~ret~ instructions by using ~jmp~ instructions which also allow
jumping to a region in memory like ~ret~. They termed it as jump-oriented
programming (JOP) attacks.


***** Protected Pointers
Cowan et. al. proposed /PointGuard/ cite:Cowan2003 which prevents pointers from
leaking by encrypting them in the memory and decrypting them only before
dereferencing. One single encryption key is used to encrypt all addresses and is
stored in a register.  It suffered from various problems like use of single key
(which can be exposed with an information leak) for all encryption and
incompatibility with existing source and binaries. Bhatkar et. al. cite:Bhatkar
introduced /Data Space Randomization/ which would extend the idea of PointGuard
to encrypt all data, pointers as well as other variables, using separate keys
and instrument binary to support it. While it promises better security than
PointGuard due to use of different encryption keys, it suffers from other
problems like binary and source incompatibility, poor performance (15%
overhead), incompatibility with unmodified libraries etc.


**** Prevention of Step 2

To prevent jumping to an attacker controlled address, *step2* of attack, a
technique called Control Flow Integrity (CFI) was proposed by by Abadi et. al
cite:Abadi:2005:CI:1102120.1102165 in 2005. It involves static analysis of the
source code to generate a call flow graph (CFG) and binary instrumentation to
enforce program flow to strictly adhere to CFG. An indirect jump from the point
of memory corruption bug to attacker controlled code is called /forward edge/
attack since it creates a forward edge in CFG.  Ligatti
et. al. cite:Ligatti2007, Tice et. al. cite:Tice2014 and many others further
improved forward edge CFI to achieve better performance without compromising the
security. A new class of CFI techniques called coarse-grained CFI relaxed strict
restrictions of original (fine grained) CFI to allow for more valid control flow
jumps like ROPecker by Cheng et. al. cite:Cheng2014 and kBouncer cite:Pappas2012
by Pappas et. al. But they were soon shown to be in-effective
cite:Davi2014,Carlini2014 against slight modifications in attack strategy.

***** GRSecurity
~RAP~ from grsecurity is a GCC plugin which implements fine-grained CFI in
Linux. It infers type information from functions and function pointers and
checks a hash value of the function type on pointer dereference to make sure
that the pointer points to the correct place. However, in existing Linux code,
several pointers have different types than the functions that they point to
which makes it a lot of work to change and then maintain(enforce it in future).


***** Hardware Techniques
~SMEP~, discussed in section [[Null Dereference]], can prevent certain classes of
ROP attacks called /ret2user/ attacks which redirect the control flow of Linux
program to user-space for gadgets. Gruss et. al. cite:Gruss2016 recently showed
that protections that prevent access to user-space like ~SMAP~, ~SMEP~, ~PXN~,
~PAX_SEGMEXEC~, ~PAX_PAGEEXEC~ can be bypassed by using ~pysmap~, a mapping of
entire user-space memory in kernel-space in Linux, to bypass all the protections
that prevent user-space access from the Kernel.

**** Prevention of Step 3

To execute *step3* in the ROP attack chain, an attacker should be able to return
back to the site of memory corruption bug in order resume the normal flow of the
program (in the compromised state.) /Stack Shield/ cite:StackShi26:online is a
tool which uses /shadow stacks/ to prevent indirect control transfers from stack
overflow attacks that overwrite return addresses. Return addresses are pushed on
to a different stack (called shadow stacks), which is protected using other
mechanisms, and compared against the return address when the function returns to
make sure it wasn't modified by an attacker. Studies by Carlini
et. al. cite:Carlini show that shadow stacks are effective in preventing
arbitrary code execution. Dang et. al. cite:Dang studied the performance
overheads of different shadow stack implementations to see if they are practical
and propose lightweight techniques to reduce performance impact of existing
shadow stack implementations. Intel recently introduced Control-flow Enforcement
Technology (CET) cite:Controlf71:online which will be a part of future
generation of Intel processors and will provide hardware support for shadow
stacks in hardware which will increase the performance of such solutions.

***** GRSecurity
~RAP~, from grsecurity, uses a technique similar to what Cowan
et. al. cite:Cowan2003 and Bhatkar et. al. cite:Bhatkar proposed previously to
prevent step 1 of ROP attack. It encrypts the return address on function call
and stores the encrypted return address and the encryption key in two registers,
when the function returns, it re-encrypts the address being returned-to and
halts execution if both of them don't match. The choice of key is not limited to
a single value for every process, long running threads in Linux like the
scheduler can use a new key on each iteration.

*** Analysis
*Code-reuse attacks* or *ROP* attacks are one of the biggest challenges
today. ASLR based protection schemes can be bypassed with data obtained from
information leak vulnerabilities, over 200 (includes un-initialized data, buffer
over-reads, other information leaks) of the which were reported in past 10
years. ~RAP~ from grsecurity/PaX encrypts return addresses and enforces
forward-edge CFI by allowing pointers to point to only valid functions that are
identified by their unique hash. However, since it uses encryption to prevent
return-addresses from being corrupted, it is susceptible to information leaks
which can reveal the encryption keys. Forward-edge CFI in ~RAP~ also depends on
the fact that function pointers can only point to specific function types which
is not enforced in C. This would require a lot of change in Linux source code to
function correctly.

Research papers that prevent pointer corruption by encrypting them in memory
suffer from a high overhead and binary-incompatibility. Coarse grained CFI
techniques improved the performance but can be easily bypassed with slight
modification in the attack strategy. Intel CET will provide support for shadow
stacks in hardware for better performance of CFI techniques in future, but would
leave others without latest hardware susceptible to ROP attacks. If these
techniques will be able to offer complete remediation against ROP, even with
support from hardware, still remains a question. ASLR and related techniques,
based on randomization of addresses have shown to be weak, but research
community hasn't given up on it yet. Newer works promise better implementation
and ideas that can possible render information leaks useless.

One point to note here is that some solutions to prevent ROP by leveraging
virtualization techniques have also been proposed. They however haven't been
covered in this survey, which studies the current security capabilities of Linux
kernel itself, as it requires an outside agent to prevent these attacks.

In Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, we discussed different types of vulnerabilities,
their exploitation methodologies and finally their defenses. Apart from some
classes like denial of service, missing permission checks etc. our survey
reveals that there exists solutions for most range of vulnerabilities that are
commonly found in Linux with varying amount of coverage and performance. Table
[[table:summary-all-defenses]] provides a summary of all the defenses discussed in
Chapter 3.

However, it is very difficult to discretely distinguish these vulnerabilities
into solved and unsolved groups due to several reasons. The most ideal
definition of a solved problem would be a defense mechanism that exists in
Mainline Linux kernel and which is enabled by default. Even though the defenses
may exist in Linux, their widespread use is seen only if they are enabled by
default. There are several reasons for why defenses are not enabled by default,
stability, compatibility with legacy software and performance are the top three
reasons.

A general feature in Linux is initially disabled by default when introduced in
the Mainline. Various distributions then configure their kernels to a desired
state and sometimes enable these features depending on the requirements of
their users. Slowly and gradually after these features have been tested with a
subset of users, these features are then enabled by default in Mainline kernel
with feedback from major distributions. This entire cycle takes a few years to
complete. Proactive defenses are often considered as features, as compared to
fixes for a specific CVE.

From here, there are several less-than-ideal states, that these defense
mechanisms can be in. Depending on the preference, stability and performance
can be traded off for better security. Various solutions exist that can be
improved in terms of performance overhead, stability and support for existing
applications, etc.

In our survey, we found that most vulnerabilities have a defense mechanism that
works. Some of them are implemented by PaX and GRSecurity patches, others have
been added to Linux over the past decade. However, the performance impact of
several of the defenses offered by PaX and GRSecurity patches leave a lot more
to be desired.

The quantitative study of the vulnerabilities draws a picture about the trends
in vulnerabilities over the years. According to Figure
[[fig:yearly-distribution-of-vulns]], the total number of vulnerabilities have been
on rise in past decade, with occasional lows. Figure [[fig:cvss-distribution]]
shows the distribution of CVSS for vulnerabilities that we analyzed. It shows
that high severity issues, while not un-common, are rare.

** Conclusions

In conclusion, the number of vulnerabilities in Linux has been on rise
effectively in past 10 years. However, the survey of defenses added to Linux
and other options that exist outside of Mainline Linux, points to an improved
overall state of security. Table [[table:summary-all-defenses]] consists of an
summary of solutions for various categories and open gaps for future research
work and areas requiring performance improvements. It is impossible to make
claims about the net-improvement in security of Linux /quantitatively/, but
theoretically, there are solutions for most of the classes of vulnerabilities
in Linux. Some of these defenses come at a cost of poor performance, but
considering the features that have already been added to Linux, it can be
safely assumed that with significant engineering efforts, these can be
incorporated in Linux to make it even more resistant.

** Future Work

Now that we know about the relative occurrences of different classes of
vulnerabilities, a logical extension of this work is to map the vulnerabilities
to different parts of Linux. Linux has a huge code base and it would be
interesting to see which parts of Linux have higher frequency of security
vulnerabilities. In a typical Linux installation, not all the parts are useful
since Linux is comprised of a large number of drivers for specific devices. By
stripping off less or un-used parts of code in Linux, which have high number of
vulnerabilities, Linux can be made more secure.
